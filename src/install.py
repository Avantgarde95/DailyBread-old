# TODO : implement installation tool

'''
[Installation process]
- Ask the user whether he want to install new / or update.
- Check the old version number if he wants to update.
- Check storage.db exists.
- Ask the user whether he want to import all data from old storage.db.
- If he wants to do that, update all data in storage.db to the new one.
  (If the structure of storage.db is changed, then we have to adjust each
  data to new form!)
